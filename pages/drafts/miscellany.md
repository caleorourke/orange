10. Blame is just a coercive way of regaining control over something you lost control of.
12. Just because letting in one idea might invite other less pleasing ideas doesn't mean you should instantly reject it.

2. Our support sucks
3. Our price sucks
4. Our product sucks

Reactions beyond this point will vary. Some will embrace this, some will feel like they got kicked in the head (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAlS_0wNUQg" target="_blank">Shakubuku</a>), and others will start writing sternly-worded emails. Whatever your reaction may be, understand that this is a cumulation of successes, failures, easy lessons, hard lessons, watching a business collapse, running a start-up, eating crow, shouting bad words across tables, toasting to victories, sleepless nights, gallons of coffee, and a lot of "aha!" moments.

## Code vs. Documentation

Anyone familiar with Agile Manifesto is probably familiar with the second key statement: *"Working software over comprehensive documentation"*. This is often interpreted as *"No docs, just code"*.

This interpretation is incorrect. Forgoing any kind of documentation is not what the Agile Manifesto intended. Rather, it preaches that working software is more useful and welcome for showcasing the building blocks of a product than presenting a bunch of PowerPoint slides. In this respect, the need for documentation is no different from other software development methodology. The only difference is in the amount of documentation and how much you need to have before getting started.

# Metrics

> "If we have a good quarter, it is because of the work we did three, four, and five years ago. It is not because we did a good job this quarter." --- *Jeff Bezos*

What we see today throughout our business today is a result of what we did months, even years, ago. And despite this not being the case in every instance, it is especially true when it comes to sales, quality, and especially the product lifecycle.

# Principles

2. Context changes tactics
4. Bad news get worse the longer you leave it
5. One metric that matters beats a hundred that don’t---use it frequently to gauge both successes and failures
8. Talk with customers throughout
9. Opinions are just guesses, not facts
10. First impressions do matter, so make your POC, Prototype, or MVP awesome
11. Hosting a workshop is more effective than any document
12. Team members are partners in our business, not some name on a hierarchy chart
13. Expectations are more important than exceptions.
14. No product has ever satisfied the needs of 100%.
15. Providing them a reason to stay is much harder than giving them a reason to switch.
