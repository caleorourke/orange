# Takeaways

Before diving in, browse through the following takeaways first.

1. Great design is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to take away.
2. Let the design emerge as the team gains experience with what is needed. This reduces the tendency to over-design.
3. An overwhelmed user responds like a priest that accidentally walks into a strip club---you can guarantee there won't be a repeat visit.
4. Doubt is part of the creative process.

# Customer Validation

> "Success is not delivering a feature. Success is learning how to solve the customer's problem." --- Mark Cook

Defining how to build a product is a challenge. Defining how to build a product that customers will pay for is an even bigger one. This is why having a firm understanding of what’s important to buyers, to users, to administrators, and so on are crucial before building a product. Without it, how well received will your product be?

In Lean Development, using hypotheses continues to be a popular tool since its induction into the [Customer Discovery](http://ventureatlanta.org/2013/03/customer-discovery-basics) process. Its popularity originates from the ability to either validate or invalidate what you’re building via experimental design.

## Falsifiable Solutions

> "Most people spend more time and energy going around problems than trying to solve them." --- Henry Ford

Creating hypotheses haphazardly are an issue. That’s because most people work it in the wrong order. In other words, they’re forcing a problem to fit a solution, rather than finding a solution that fits a problem. And they usually derail any chances of user acceptance in the process, especially if they’re trying to design problems to fit a list of “nice-to-have” features.

Arriving at what’s important is the basis of a good hypothesis. Whether it will be successful is not explicitly stated, but it shows you that there is a need to test it. Therefore, a solution should derive from examining the problem and creating a falsifiable solution for it. A good hypothesis always starts without a solution.

## Types of Hypotheses

Most people would suggest that you work the C-P-S hypothesis as it was intended---starting with the Customer, then onto the Problem and Solution. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t build onto it or work it differently.

### 1. Baseline

While drawing up solutions to your problems, ask yourself this: “What’s the simplest thing we can do to prove our hypothesis?”

It’s an important baseline to consider for your design experiment. However, most people get caught up in the particulars of how they’re going to test it, rather than trying to solve it. If you were one of them, a good approach would be to consider the simplest way to prove it while creating your solution to the problem.

### 2. Attitude-Occurrence-Commitment

Adding three extra properties to the C-P-S hypothesis broadens the view of what you are setting up for your design experiment. Rather than only using Customer-Problem-Solution, scale the hypothesis more to include Attitude, Occurrence, and Commitment. What you have now is:

* Customer
* Attitude
* Problem
* Occurrence
* Commitment
* Solution

> Attitude, Occurrence, and Commitment rally around the Problem. This is "by design" in order to keep you confined in that area before you branch out to the Solution.

Below is an example of using Attitude-Occurrence-Commitment.

* Customer: Subscriber
* Attitude: Extremely angry, hostile
* Problem: Expired subscriptions are disabling websites instantly because they opted out for renewal during initial sign-up
* Occurrence: On the subscriber’s anniversary date
* Commitment: Ensure service isn't interrupted until subscriber is notified and has time to renew
* Solution: Send daily alerts and provide a 15-day grace period before disabling service

### 3. Scenario

Fans of “fill in the blank” scenarios should enjoy this option. Using this template below may be an easier format to work with.

<q>[Customers] need to [do something][how often]. We help them [solve a problem] by [providing a solution].</q>

*Non-technical users need to verify if new updates are available each time they start the app. We help them get the most recent updates by sending ‘check_update’ requests and notifying them when an update is available.*

### 4. Job Story

Check out [Replacing the User Story with the Job Story](http://alanklement.blogspot.com/2013/09/replacing-user-story-with-job-story.html) by Alan Klement. His approach eliminates assumptions and disconnects between the user/persona and what you’re building.
