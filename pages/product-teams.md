> "It all starts with a great idea and teamwork." --- Garrett Camp

Product Teams are a group of peers working together to bring one or more projects to completion. Each product line (i.e. compute, storage, apps) has its own dedicated Product Team. This means teams are less fluid, more balanced, and have a better chance at normalizing and improving with each project cycle. Knowing what each other brings to the table and maintaining a consistent rhythm also prevents overlapping work, miscommunication, burnout, or worse.

# Takeaways

Before diving in, browse through the following takeaways first.

1. Balanced teams makes better products. Team up with people that share your vision and have a passion to succeed.
2. A good Team starts by asking “what” and “how”. A successful Team starts by asking “why” and "why not".
3. Teams must always be able to talk and work together without managers interfering or disrupting their momentum.
4. “*A clever merchant hides his goods and pretends to have nothing*” (Tao proverb). In other words, be modest and control your ego.
5. The best decision is one you never have to make. But if you have to live with it, do you really want someone else making that decision?
6. When you criticize someone, you make it harder for them to change. Be constructive and patient.
7. A lack of respect from one member will lead to a lack of participation from others.
8. The worst distance between two people is misunderstanding.
9. If you lose interest, your next task is to hand your work off to a competent successor.

# Mindsets

Mindsets are contagious. They can either inspire and stimulate, or yield enough coercion and tension to kill everyone's morale. This means your attitude, motives, and behavior have the wielding power to make or break pivotal improvements not only for our products, but for our business culture.

In most organizations, there are two dominant mindsets: "productive" and "defensive". The productive mindset seeks valid knowledge, creates informed choices, and makes reasoning transparent. The defensive one is self-protective, self-deceptive, and only seeks information that will protect them.

The table below shows what kind of traits you can expect from these mindsets.

| Defensive | Productive |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Alienates people | Attracts people |
| Assumes | Questions |
| Breaks rules | Changes rules |
| Coercive | Helpful |
| Complains | Creates |
| Doubts success is possible | Believes success is possible |
| Energy-zapping | Energy-generating |
| Enjoys disrupting others | Limits disruptions |
| Looks for problems | Looks for possibilities |
| Points fingers | Finds causes |
| Self-focused | Mission-focused |
| Short-sighted | Forward-thinking |
| Victim | Helper |
| Wants to make it through the day | Wants to learn something new everyday |
| Worries about | Wonders if |

## The "Not Invented Here" Fallacy

Aside from mindsets, a common fallacy among engineers is the "Not Invented Here" mentality. This is the unwillingness to adopt the work of open source communities and your peers because it didn't originate from you or your buddy. In psychology terms, this is not attributed to team dynamics; rather, it's a coercive cocktail of __tribalism__ and __favoritism__ brought on by big egos, faux intentions, or self-serving ambition.

This fallacy maims advances in technology and business growth in a number of ways, which include:

* Making and implementing critical decisions without consulting or informing the Product or Business Owner
* Killing participation by alienating other peers while you "go at it alone"
* Wasting time and resources finding reasons "not to" rather than reasons "to"
* Slowing progress by reinventing instead of reworking

And while most engineers claim to have "good intentions", it's important to remember one thing: Hitler also claimed he had good intentions.

# Command-Control-Execute

Rolling elaboration is essential to any project. We especially need a way to control movement from end-to-end and prevent leaks or overlapping work from occurring. By applying a simple hierarchy, we can control when tasks start, prevent disruptions, and stop unfinished work from slipping by. This hierarchy model is simply known as __Command-Control-Execute__.

![Command-Control-Execute](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5603/15473953070_827fce1777.jpg)

The best definition for hierarchy derives from a 1998 NATO Charter:

<q>"The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated individual over assigned resources in the accomplishment of a common goal."</q>

To give you a little background, the origins for Command-Control-Exrcute trace back to the U.S. Army. They needed a simplistic and agile way to handle missions, projects, training, or any number of situations---even those outside of the military. As of 2012, all branches and agencies linked to the U.S. armed forces have adopted it in one form or another.

## Modern-Day Practices

Command-Control-Execute has been used heavy outside of the military. Chances are you've already used it and didn't know it. The most popular use of it in product development is with __Scrum__.

Consider the three main roles in Scrum: the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the Team. These roles were crafted deliberately as a way to adopt Command-Control-Execute. The table below shows how each role matches up.

| Military | Scrum         |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Command  | Product Owner |
| Control  | Scrum Master  |
| Execute  | Team          |

## Adaptation

In terms of developing a product, the Command-Control-Execute hierarchy easily translates into __Strategy-Project-Delivery__.

| Military | Product         |
| -------- | --------------- |
| Command  | Strategy (Core) |
| Control  | Project         |
| Execute  | Delivery        |

With this hierarchy, we can set constraints at each level, such as:

* The core strategy must be defined first
* A project won't initiate until a core strategy has been defined
* Efforts toward release (delivery) won't start until a project has been initiated

# Work Groups

"Product Team" is an overarching term for two distinct teamlets, better known as *work groups*: the [Core Group](#core-group) and the [Delivery Group](#delivery-group). Sandwiched in between these groups is Project Management.

| Military | Product         | Work Groups        |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Command  | Strategy (Core) | Core Group         |
| Control  | Project         | Project Management |
| Execute  | Delivery        | Delivery Group     |

![Work Group](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3941/15661836651_908213d97a_z.jpg)

## Core Group

With the need for constant business involvement, while at the same time setting and managing expectations, the Core Group acts as the conduit for the business. They're responsible for priority, deciding what's active, making key decisions, and fully understanding the business vision. Below is a brief description of this group.

* The first pass at developing a product
* Transforms vision into strategy
* Composed of Business, Design, and Technology
* The lead for the Core Group is the __Product Advocate__

![Biz-Design-Tech](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3938/15478526968_cf8eefa106.jpg)

## Delivery Group

The Core Group relays the business needs to the Delivery Group in order to align efforts that meet our strategic goals and market initiatives. The Delivery Group, in turn, becomes responsible for delivering the product agreed upon while keeping true to the health of the teams.

Below is a brief description of this group.

* The second pass at developing a product
* Transforms strategy into tactics
* Composed of Engineering, Ops, and Quality
* The lead for the Delivery Group is the __Dev Advocate__
* The responsibilities of other business units---Finance, Marketing, Sales, Support, so on---are buffered under the Delivery Group

## Where's Project Management?

To keep the momentum going and prevent things from becoming unglued, it's imperative that the __Project Advocate__ works in concert to ensure that the solution delivered meets the needs of the business without destroying morale along the way. One of the “due diligences” that person has is ensuring that the Dev Advocate delivers as expected, while also ensuring the Product Advocate doesn't over-commit.

The table below shows how the role of each owner lines up with Command-Control-Execute.

| Military | Product         | Work Groups        | Roles            |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Command  | Strategy (Core) | Core Group         | Product Advocate |
| Control  | Project         | Project Management | Project Advocate |
| Execute  | Delivery        | Delivery Group     | Dev Advocate     |

# Roles

Our approach breaks groups apart into five separate roles.

* Advocates
* Contributors
* Experts
* Evangelists
* Facilitators

This table defines each group under their specific roles.

# Responsibilities

Forming a new Product Team comes with its challenges, and those challenges affect everyone---even customers. Knowing who's responsible for what keeps everyone in perspective and avoids clashing when it comes to surviving the dynamics and the pressures of our business.

| Business Unit | Responsibility | Inputs and Outputs |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Engineering | <ul><li>CTO of the product</li><li>Provides estimates</li><li>Participates in syncs and meetups</li><li>Verifies Exit Criteria</li><li>Performs Unit/Regression testing</li></ul> | <ul><li>Technical Planning</li><li>Release Notes</li><li>Estimates</li><li>GO for Code Release</li><li>Test Cases</li><li>Specifications</li><li>GO for Product Release</li></ul> |
| Executives | <ul><li>CFO of the product</li><li>Checks financial health and integrity of product</li><li>Prioritizes</li><li>Protects revenue</li><li>Negotiates with Vendors and Partners</li></ul> | <ul><li>Opportunities</li><li>Product Backlog</li><li>Priorities</li><li>GO for Product Release</li></ul> |
| Marketing | <ul><li>CMO of the product</li><li>Provides content related to marketing, sales, and launch</li><li>Represents the product to the outside world</li></ul> | <ul><li>Launch Plan</li><li>Marketing Communication</li><li>GO for Marketing Launch</li></ul> |
| Product Management | <ul><li>CEO of the product</li><li>Writes and validates Exit Criteria</li><li>Participates in meetups</li><li>Updates priorities</li><li>Drives planning and milestones</li><li>Provides vertical-focus on long and short term product strategies</li></ul> | <ul><li>Product Backlog</li><li>Priorities</li><li>Deliverables</li><li>Product Requirements</li><li>Exit Criteria</li><li>Postmortem</li><li>Premortem</li><li>GO for Product Release</li></ul> |

# Kaizen

In Japanese, kaizen ([ky-zen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EbZhR9pJSE)) translates to “good change”, although a widely accepted translation is “continuous improvement”. Any workplace where the entire workforce focuses on continually improving quality, on productivity, and on customer satisfaction, is a kaizen culture.

![Kaizen](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3948/15663572945_a5d4a4859a_n.jpg)

Here, teams are empowered. They take action. They swarm on problems. They discuss options for providing fixes and improvements. In essence, teams are nurtured, not “built”, and evolve in a spontaneous, self-organized manner.

Kaizen also involves solid collaboration and a collegial atmosphere where everyone puts the health of the teams and the business above themselves. This systems-level thinking enhances their performance more and more over time.

## Where Improvement is Necessary

Now is a good time to mention that kaizen is much more than a way to improve team collaboration. It’s a means of improving where improvement is necessary. And this process isn’t clocked or time-boxed---it can occur when a scenario requiring improvement becomes clear.

For example, reviewing data captured after a project has finished---via bookends like postmortems or retrospectives---is an ideal method of spotting weak points and working with the teams (or managers) to improve them.

## Get Buy-In

Instilling a kaizen culture is not easy, and it certainly will not happen overnight. It requires buy-in from not only each individual team but also management. Everyone must be willful participants. Otherwise, without their willingness, encouragement and support, all efforts will be worthless.

## Set Expectations

Now, the bad news. Getting buy-in is the easy part. Getting it off the ground is the hard part. Even with everyone’s blessing, you might find barriers in your way. The important thing to understand here is that you’re disturbing their habitat and they do not like it.

It usually begins with unrest, and moves to chaos before everyone starts to adjust, normalize and ease back into his or her habitat. This may sound painful, but it’s no different from what we see in nature.

Of course, you can mitigate this by getting out in front and letting them know what to expect.

### Expectations for Managers

Here are a set of expectations to discuss while working with managers.

* __Managers must tolerate__ small failures in the name of improvement
* __Managers must enable__ “stop the line” behavior
* __Managers must encourage__ teams to swarm in order to resolve problems
* __Managers must raise the level__ of social capital within the teams

### Expectations for Teams

And in case managers feel they’re being singled out, here are a set of expectations to discuss while working with each team.

* __Teams must be transparent__ with their work
* __Teams must interact with others__, including stakeholders
* __Teams must make time__ to collaborate and help others
* __Teams must trust__ Management
* __Teams must work without supervision__ to make tough prioritization and scheduling decisions

Again, kaizen is not a team-building routine; it’s a culture change that starts with improving the team and then branches outwards to improve the business as a whole. It won’t be easy, and it certainly won’t be quick. But, kaizen is a solid and proven way to improve your business where improvement is necessary.
