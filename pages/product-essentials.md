> "Success is the ability to go from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm." --- Sir Winston Churchill

Successful development requires an approach that rejects fixed standards in favor of more practical, balanced ones. This includes a set of new practices, adaptive workstreams, and the ability to bulldoze straight through any gridlock to deliver __valuable__, __sustainable__, and __authentic__ products.

# Takeaways

Before jumping in, browse through these takeaways to get a better understanding of the underlying context.

1. At each step, ask yourself, "This is one way, but is it the *best* way?"
2. Resist natural approaches in favor of unnatural approaches---the more unnatural it is, the more agile it is.
3. Four threats to any product are assumptions, responsibilities, interest, and knowledge.
4. Assumptions need to be called out constantly. Make this a priority for each team meeting.
5. Knowledge is not a privilege, it’s an implicit guarantee we make to our customers.
6. Quality is a customer determination, not an engineering, marketing, or management determination.
7. Always maintain a "negotiate schedule, not scope" stance.
8. No matter what business you're in, the world outside is flat. Your team needs to be flat as well.

# Feature-Driven Philosophy

Development methods exist on a continuum from **predictive** to **adaptive**.

* On the predictive end, you deliver plans and dates. This means your product must be out by a set date.
* On the adaptive end, you deliver value and features. This means your product is only released when it’s deemed show-ready.

## Predictive & Date-Driven

_Date-driven is a natural, predictive approach that sacrifices elasticity to meet an arbitrary date_. Trying to develop quickly is not only difficult, it's disruptive and taxing. Everything usually grinds to a halt at some point post-discovery and teams often cut corners to make up that lost time.

## Adaptive & Feature-Driven

_Feature-driven is an unnatural, adaptive approach with maximum value, flexibility, and minimal recoil_. The only people who suffer heartache are those that cling to some arbitrary launch date like it's the Second Coming of Christ.

With an industry in-flux and an inert need to stay on the heels of your competitors, any number of circumstances can force you to drop everything and change plans. You must be vigilant and, of course, adaptive in order to develop quickly. That’s why having a **flexible, feature-driven philosophy** is necessary for adaptability.

# Principles

Harnessing several Lean principles as the basic platform should inspire new conduct at multiple levels. These principles include:

1. [Adapt to Change](#adapt-to-change)
2. [Create Knowledge](#create-knowledge)
3. [Deliver Incremental Value](#deliver-incremental-value)
4. [Eliminate Waste](#eliminate-waste)
5. [Improve Continuously](#improve-continuously)
6. [Open Up Communication](#open-up-communication)
7. [Optimize the Whole](#optimize-the-whole)
8. [Test Early, Test Often](#test-early,-test-often)
9. [Use Visual Controls](#use-visual-controls)

## Adapt to Change

To maximize your technology investment, you have to venture further into new territories. Most of this occurs during discovery, but changes can erupt at any time as you learn more about what's needed. Worse yet, it's impossible to shield a project from this. As a standard principle, all core team members must remain available throughout a project so they can contribute to decisions arising from these changes and help their fellow peers adapt quickly.

## Create Knowledge

Each development project, environment, and team is unique, and each iteration offers a learning opportunity. Knowledge that is not transferred or planted along the way is lost. Be intentional about facilitating knowledge exchange in a consistent way. Learn what customers know and let the requirements emerge based on what they learn while doing, and not just by what they're asking for.

## Deliver Incremental Value

Small, quality deliverables show progress, promote learning, and improve team morale. They also help detect risks, bugs, missing requirements, and force decisions to be made early. Several ways to deliver more frequently include:

* Keeping the scope small
* Working on deliverables in a “just-in-time” manner
* Leaving options open by not making premature decisions
* Using a Kanban board to identify where bottlenecks are occurring

## Eliminate Waste

Eliminate anything that creates waste, including---but not limited to---the following.

| Waste Element | Examples | Business Outcome |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Defects | <ul><li>Unauthorized system and app changes</li><li>Substandard project execution</li></ul> | <ul><li>Poor service</li><li>Increased costs</li></ul> |
| Overprovisioning | <ul><li>Unnecessary delivery of low-value apps and services</li></ul> | <ul><li>Engineering and Ops misalignment</li><li>Increased costs and overheads in energy, data center space, and maintenance</li></ul> |
| Waiting | <ul><li>Slow app response times</li><li>Manual escalation procedures</li></ul> | <ul><li>Lost revenue</li><li>Poor customer service</li><li>Reduced productivity</li></ul> |
| Non-Value Added Processing | <ul><li>Reporting metrics to business managers</li></ul> | <ul><li>Miscommunication</li></ul> |
| Excessive Inventory | <ul><li>Underutilized hardware</li><li>Multiple repositories to handle risks and control</li><li>Benched app development teams</li></ul> | <ul><li>Increased costs</li><li>Lost productivity</li></ul> |
| Excessive Motion | <ul><li>Fire-fighting repeat problems within the infrastructure and apps</li></ul> | <ul><li>Lost productivity</li></ul> |
| Unused Knowledge | <ul><li>Failing to capture ideas</li><li>Retention issues</li></ul> | <ul><li>Employees wasting energy on repetitive or mundane tasks</li></ul> |

## Improve Continuously

Working to constantly improve is the number one way in which many businesses reduce operating overhead and streamline work. Efficient work saves time and money, allowing you to reduce wasted effort and expenditures. For example, projects where milestones keep getting pushed to the right, priorities change at each meeting, or decisions are left unmade are filled with opportunities to improve; someone just has to take the initiative to own it and work through it.

## Open Up Communication

Not so long ago, businesses modeled their projects purely on a need-to-know basis, which always lead to misunderstandings and impaired the ability of a team to deliver products successfully. And despite a few sects that still maintain this tradition, most have adopted an open, honest communication flow---both within the team and stakeholders.

A free-flow of information not only reduces the chances of misunderstandings and wastes, but also ensures that all team members are battle-ready and working to reduce uncertainties surrounding the project. This is why communication must be unrestricted and transparent, especially when it comes to navigating an empirical-like org or getting through the impenetrable blanket draped over you.

## Optimize the Whole

Don't think <var>n=1</var>, think <var>n=many</var> by focusing on the entire portfolio of products---not just the product you're working on today. Do what is needed to improve the overall workflow, to develop the most valuable features, and to write high-quality code.

## Test Early, Test Often

Quality is built into the product, not tested in. It's part of the overall product design. Use practices to instill design choices that create sustainable, less complex, more flexible code. In turn, you'll spend less time fixing bugs and more time improving the code quality to enhance performance, reliability, and efficiency.

Additionally, it's important for each team understands what quality means. With so many definitions out there, it's important to work off the same one. For this reason, we use the definition from __A. V. Feigenbaum__ to define quality.

<q>"Quality is a customer determination, not an engineering, marketing, or management determination. It is based on the customer's actual experience with the product or service, measured against his or her requirements---stated or unstated; conscious or merely sensed; technically operational or entirely subjective---and always represents a moving target in a competitive market".</q>

## Use Visual Controls

Metrics, content repositories, project dashboards, issue trackers, task management applications, and so on, must be visible to not only the team members, but also stakeholders, contributors, anyone else that has skin in the game. You should definitely consider restricting permissions to some of these resources, but restricting access to only a few team members is different. If they can't see it, it's not exactly "visual", wouldn't you say?

# Constructs

Twelve essential constructs provide a basic template for creating new practices. And just like most constructs, these guide change initiatives by narrowing the field to focus on those paths that fit best within your ecosystem.

1. Eliminate assumptions
2. Try it first, code later
3. Set boundaries
4. Decide on priorities from Day 1
5. Start with less
6. Design from the outside-in
7. Pull by demand
8. Inspect and adapt
9. Maintain momentum
10. Defer dates, not expectations
11. Level up
12. Validate everything

# Introducing New Practices

Transforming processes into a collection of practices is fundamental to the {{site.github.name}}. Each one needs to be built on the premise of having __visibility__, __consistency__, and __boundaries__. Once you have those in place, then it's just a matter of defining, testing, reworking, and adopting them incrementally to improve your way of working.

To get started, first you'll need to:

1. Get a firm understanding of the basic constructs for creating new practices---see [Business Rules](#business-rules).
2. Select the weakest processes first and either cope temporarily with other challenges or find coverage to man them.
3. Implement new practices in whatever combination and at whatever speed you're comfortable with.
4. Verify how the new practices impact your existing work routines.
5. Rinse and repeat.

> A crucial part of governing is not to throw teams off-balance by pushing too much, too fast. Otherwise, you risk a mutiny or a mass exodus.

# Where Changes Matters

Below are areas where you have the wielding power to make pivotal improvements.

| Existing Process | New Practice |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Backlog is controlled by development | Backlog is shared across teams |
| Tasks cannot change while an iteration is in progress | Tasks can be added whenever there is capacity |
| Priorities cannot change while an iteration is in progress | Priorities can be changed if approved |
| Commits to work each iteration | Commits to work for each project |
| Doesn't enforce explicit policies | Enforces explicit policies |
| Keeps upper-management at bay | Keeps upper-management informed |
| Limits WIP by iterations | Limits WIP across teams |
| Makes black-boxing development easy | Makes development input, work and output visible |
| Requires well-formed teams before starting | Focuses on workflow rather than team normalization |
| Splits work to fit in iterations | Sizes the entire project |
| Uses Burndown Charts | Uses Custom Metrics |
| Uses time-boxed iterations | Uses iterations without time-boxing |
| Uses velocity as the metric for planning | Uses value as the metric for planning |
| Resets work between iterations | Work stays persistent |

# Threats

Every person that touches a product has to be conscientious of four threats. They're often referred to as __enders__, and if you avoid them, neglect them, or defer them outright, you'll jeopardize any chance of having a successful product.

1. [Assumptions](#assumptions)
2. [Responsibilities](#responsibilities)
3. [Interest](#interest)
4. [Knowledge](#knowledge)

## Assumptions

By habit, team members often compare a new product with similar products they worked on in the past, thereby already making assumptions that are not accurate. Eliminate these early-on and often. Make this a priority for each team meeting.

## Responsibilities

Job titles get in the way of things, especially high-ranking titles. Some exert their powers unintentionally, while others are just dicks. Whatever the case may be, responsibilities should be doled out by roles, not by job titles. This is why frameworks use roles, like Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Code Keeper, to describe what kind of input and output a person under that role should be producing. It also prevents people with high-ranking titles from offloading work that they should be doing.

## Interest

Interest is an emotion (obviously). But contrary to popular belief, interest has as much to do with keeping people positive as it does with keeping them actively engaged.

Interest teeters awfully close to the negative half of emotion. This means the slightest breeze of __negativity__, __rejection__, __abandonment__, __neglect__, and __deception__ can transform an actively interested person or team into a completely uninterested one. This is why [having a productive mindset]({{page.baseurl}}product-teams/#mindsets) is important among teams. It's also important to remember we're all human, and just like with death and taxes, you're certainly going to have bad days. Unfortunately, team members often come under fire when your emotions unload. Admitting that you overreacted and apologizing for your attack will not only remove any tension, it can bring teams closer together.

## Knowledge

Rather than discussing why knowledge sharing fails, a more effective, eye-opening approach is to show the excuses people make when they're asked to train their peers.

* "How come I had to figure it out but no one else has to?"
* "It's so easy. If they can't get it working, they're idiots."
* "It's not my job to train people."
* "And when am I supposed to find time to do this? Do you have any idea how much work I have?"

Despite the excuses, there is one simple truth: _Knowledge is not a privilege, it's an implicit guarantee we make to our customers_. That's why you must be intentional about facilitating knowledge exchange in a consistent way. You also need to harness what customers know and let the requirements emerge based on what they learn while doing. See [Create Knowledge](#create-knowledge).
