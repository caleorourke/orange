> "The winning army realizes the conditions for victory first, then fights. The losing army fights first, then seeks victory." --- Sun Tsu

Ideas come from needing to scratch an itch. Having a strategy takes it beyond being just an itch. But unlike ideas, strategies are finite and plausible. This is why each product strategy needs to survey market conditions, business objectives, and potential avenues for growth.

# Takeaways

Before diving in, browse through the following takeaways first.

1. Don’t confuse a product strategy with a business strategy. Product strategies bridge business strategies and projects.
2. Define a future for the product that stakeholders know and endorse.
3. If your product is your dream, there's no harm in dreaming big. But remember, architectural and technical limitations cannot be dreamt away.
4. Roadmaps under one year are not strategic enough; more than two years are not realistic enough.
5. Don’t psych out your strategy by focusing on operational complexities.
6. Strategies formulate, projects initiate. Articulating your strategy too soon is a good way to false start a project.
7. If "testing-in quality" is bad, making up a strategy halfway through a project is worse.
8. The most striking and innovative solutions often come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
9. It’s better to start with a simple hypothesis than to make knee-jerk decisions with inaccurate data.
10. Crucial questions about requirements should be resolved in minutes and hours---not days and weeks.
11. A product isn’t a product until you put emphasis on “making” it. Without that, all you have is static.

# Vision-Strategy-Product

When an idea hits you, it rushes in as one big wave. However, it usually stops there. You probably never take the time to sashimi this idea into smaller chunks. Instead, you race to the nearest whiteboard, call an "all-hands" meeting, and try to pitch a product you've prematurely fallen in love with.

Rather than cutting in line, _each idea should get pulled individually through each layer of the Vision-Strategy-Product triangle, or the **Product Scaffold**_.

![Product Scaffold](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5612/15366445050_1cc8f2aab8.jpg)

This scaffold is not only a good mental model, it can be weaved into a simple workflow by building visual controls at each layer. In addition, you can gather abstract motives easily by examining "Why?", "How?", and "What?".

* Vision --- "Why this is a good idea."
* Strategy --- "How we're going to implement this."
* Product --- "What we need to accomplish our goals."

> Watch Simon Sinek's "[Start With Why](http://youtu.be/yLYNU0OOMK4)" talk to learn more about this and the Golden Circle.

## Vision

The vision is a product's true north. It's intended to provide the critical information you must know to start developing your product, which may include rationale and purpose for an idea. Furthermore, _the vision communicates the fundamental "Why?" and acts as a compass for validating future decisions_. A good way to convey a vision is through a [vision document](#vision-document).

## Strategy

Strategy breaks down a big vision into an implementation plan (strategy) that's built from knowledge of studying existing __analogs/antilogs__, as well as having conversations among team members, stakeholders, advisors, and even customers. It ultimately elicits buy-in by providing some form of justification. Think of it as the "How?" for your idea.

Three good ways of writing a strategy include the [Business Case](#business-case), the [Product Definition](#product-definition), and a [Strategic Roadmap](#strategic-roadmap).

> "Analogs" are successful products built from an idea. "Antilogs" are successful products built from an idea and eventually failed. As an example, an analog for the iPod would be the Walkman, and its antilog would be Napster.

## Product

_Product is where strategy transforms into the tactical work that's required to make something tangible_. Think of it as the "What?". This is usually where the [bulk of your documentation](#requirements) gets created.

---

# Documentation

From a drawing on a napkin, to a wireframe, to a paper prototype, to product requirements, documents not only play a critical role in the evolution of a product, they provide the substances to justify, understand, build, maintain, support, and much more.

## Vision Document

A vision document captures the essence of an envisaged solution in the form of high-level requirements and constraints. This gives stakeholders and team members a non-functional overview. It also provides input for initiating a project and is, therefore, closely related to a business case.

A well-written vision document generally contains:

* Objectives
* Product Overview
* Target Markets
* Major Features
* Limitations
* Critical Success Factors

## Business Case

A business case includes information about the business goals and how they align with your vision. A well-documented business case includes:

* Market Sizing
* Product Feasibility
* Product Profitability
* Risks
* Go-to-Market Strategy

## Product Definition

The product definition is a blended set of features, specifications, deliverables, and artifacts related to a new product offering. Some content is tooled specifically for different business units, and some content is inclusive to everybody. A well-documented product definition includes:

* Product Vision
* Product Description
* Features
* Functionality
* Pricing
* Roadmap
* Milestones
* Constraints

## Strategic Roadmap

Typically paired with a Product or Application Portfolio, the strategic roadmap forecasts where your product will strike your marketspace, shows how it coincides with your __investments__, and where it fit in your __product catalog__. Use it to map out fluid milestones for new product releases, as a calendar for scheduled projects, or as a backlog for pending projects. But don't forget the most important reason for providing a roadmap: to give everyone insight into your long-term plans.

See the example below.

| Product | Investments | Catalog    | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q4+ |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------- |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:---:|
| A       | Reduce     | Marketplace | X  |    |    |    |     |
| B       | Raise      | Network     |    |    | X  |    |     |
| C       | Create     | DBaaS       |    |    | X  |    |     |
| D       | Raise      | Endpoints   |    |    |    | X  |     |
| E       | Eliminate  | Compute     |    |    |    |    | X   |
| F       | Eliminate  | Marketplace |    |    |    |    | X   |

## Requirements

A great primer for defining your product all depends on the team. While you were peeling away the top layers of the Product Scaffold, you probably consulted a number of your peers for their expertise. Now that you've reached the Product layer, your peers have more skin in the game. As such, each person should contribute their work using a format that's suitable for their responsibilities.

Most teams typically include (in alphabetical order):

* [Engineers](#engineers)
* [Product Architects](#architects)
* [Product Designers](#product-designers)
* [Product Managers](#product-managers)
* [Project Managers](#project-managers)
* [UI Designers](#ui-designers)

### Architects

Architects draft their work in the form of diagrams and technical requirements. Well-documented requirements include:

1. ==Insert something here==
2. ==Insert something here==
3. ==Insert something here==

### Engineers

Engineers draft their work in the form of functional requirements. Well-documented requirements include:

1. ==Insert something here==
2. ==Insert something here==
3. ==Insert something here==

### Product Designers

Product Designers draft their work in the form of business, market, or user requirements. Well-documented requirements includes:

1. Prototypes
2. ==Insert something here==
3. ==Insert something here==
4. ==Insert something here==

### Product Managers

Product Managers draft their work in the form of product requirements. Well-documented requirements includes:

1. Feasibility
2. Deliverables
3. High-level Requirements
4. Feature-Sets
5. Milestones

### Project Managers

Project Managers draft their work in a number of different forms. Examples include:

* ==Insert something here==
* ==Insert something here==
* ==Insert something here==

### UI Designers

Designers draft their work in a number of different forms. Examples include:

1. Wireframes
2. User research
3. User personas
4. User stories
5. Journey maps

# Investments

A healthy balance of investments is necessary to anticipate what your level of commitment is for specific product ventures. Otherwise, an overabundance of work in one area means you have to trim work in others.

The __Four-Point Framework__ below (a derivative from [Blue Ocean Strategy](http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition/dp/1591396190/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0)) is one of many tools outlined within this book to build uncontested marketspace.

![Four-Point Framework](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3934/15366065617_8c20540d7d_z.jpg)

But in a business with a large, diverse portfolio of products, finding uncontested marketspaces cannot be the only goal you pursue. You have a number of other factors that come into play, such as saturated markets, legacy products, contracts with vendors, and SLAs. For these reasons, and many more, the percentages should help you concentrate only so much fire at one area.

| Four-Points | Meaning                       | Allocation |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ----------:|
| Eliminate   | Killing a product or service  | 15% |
| Reduce      | Starving a product or service | 5% |
| Raise       | Cutting-edge technology       | 55% |
| Create      | Bleeding-edge technology      | 25% |

The following points provide a brief explanation for these percentages.

__Eliminate over Reduce.__ Killing products is just as important as making them. Like pruning a plant, cutting off dying parts makes the rest stronger. It's tempting to just leave old products running, simply because they're already built, you have *x* number of users using it, or because sales people freak instinctively when they have one less product to pitch.

However, keeping the product around still eats resources. Sometimes it's money. Sometimes it's people. And just because some users are paying for it doesn't mean you're not hemorrhaging cash to keep them around. To express this mathematically, let's consider you're spending $2,000/mo on production and administration cost (*cogs*) to keep this product around. You have 5 customers using it, and you're making $1,250 in revenue (*r*) from all those customers. A good gross margin (*gm*) usually falls between 40%-80%. Yours is -60%. This means not only are you bleeding cost, you're also not making any money.

<q>($1,250<sub>r</sub> - $2,000<sub>cogs</sub>) &divide; $1,250<sub>r</sub> &middot; 100% = (-60%)<sub>gm</sub>

__Raise over Create.__ Bleeding-edge technology is a high-risk gamble. On one hand, it can have a huge payout if it gains strong traction in uncontested markets. On the other hand, it can leave a gaping hole in our cash flow if it never gains traction. Either way, gambling is what we have to do to innovative. But, a modest way of gambling is to put more stakes in cutting-edge technology than bleeding-edge.

# Priorities

Prioritization requires you to consider two factors: "value" and "risk".

* Value: Relative, non-monetary worth, merit, or importance of a feature, product, or service
* Risk: Level of exposure we're willing to chance on taking a loss

Each item on the backlog has a number of values and risks to consider. Once you estimate the relative weight of each item, you can prioritize backlog items to deliver business value early.

This is a simple calculation once you've determined what type of values to reference and assign each one a relative weight. Then, you tally up the weight of each distinct business value (*v*) and divides it by the level of risk (*r*) associated with it. The result is a relative weight, or total (*t*), that can be used to determine its priority.

<q>t = v<sub>1</sub> + v<sub>2</sub> + v<sub>3</sub> + v<sub>4</sub> + v<sub>5</sub> &divide; r</q>

## Loudest In, First Out

Changing priorities based on whoever's screaming the loudest or whoever is building up the most pressure is not prioritization; it's ordering. Priorities measures business value. They do not factor in pressure, sensitivity, or coercion---factors known as __political value__. Therefore, changing the order using political values negates the priorities created by business value.

# Opportunity Assessments

Assessing opportunities moves you away from heavyweight Market Requirements and Product Requirements to a lightweight, high-fidelity prototype. It’s a quick and easy method of gauging an idea before investing truckloads of time researching it. However, it’s important to note that it’s not a substitute for those requirements.

This assessment is beneficial because it:

* Weighs the risks against the needs
* Provides a brief understanding of what will be required
* Prevents the waste of time and money on half-baked investments

[Click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Be6v-tqqHKxPGGwgmecC80aiDmmogGgqResckUvfbns/pubhtml) to view and download the Opportunity Assessment spreadsheet.

## Focus Areas

This assessment looks at three focus areas.

| Focus Area | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Desirability | Measures the idea’s ability to survive and its appeal to buyers and users |
| Feasibility | Measures the amount of energy required and its benefit |
| Viability | Measures ROI, cash flow and recurring revenue cycles |

![Triangle](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3947/15552074595_15410c7719.jpg)

## Desirability

Desirability targets specific criteria drivers to gauge if an opportunity meets the standards for:

1. Business Objectives
2. Competitive Urgency
3. Market Value
4. Market Window
5. Strategic Potential

Below is an outline of each driver. Certain line items may need some tweaking, though, depending on your business.

| Criteria Drivers | Description |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| Barrier to Entry | Makes the "barrier to entry" easier if introduced before all major competitors |
| Brand Equity | Builds brand awareness and credibility |
| Buyer Centric | Meets buyers expectations |
| Costs | Decreases investment cost |
| Delighter | Reels in new customers |
| Dominance | Leapfrogs the competition |
| Emerging Trend | Consistent with emerging industry trends |
| Emotional | Improves perceptions about our business |
| End-of-Sales | Migrates existing buyers away from legacy products |
| Expenses | Lowers operating expenses |
| Frequency | Used daily to provide operational efficiency |
| Impact | Resolves significant and frequent problems |
| Marketability | Evangelizing by placement, pricing, etc. |
| Market Position | Grows market share and improves competitive posture |
| Market Entry | A first-entry market leader if we act now |
| Obligation | Fulfills commitments made to customers |
| Organic Growth | Provides significant payback through growth |
| Revenue | Increases revenue within 6 months |
| Significance | Pulls clients away from contractual obligations with competitors |
| Strategic | Continues to add growth in the future |

## Feasibility

Measuring feasibility without having time to herd everyone together and explain everything is an impossible task. Don’t get overwhelmed by this section. Keep it simple and remember that it's not a commitment, it's not initiating a project, and you're not obligated to send it to anyone if you don't want to.

| Focus Area | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Effort | Estimates how many man-weeks it will take for the entire Team to complete the project |
| Risk | Provides six types of risks to review and decide which the best fit is |
| Team Size | The head count for all Team members involved |
| Sales | Estimates the number of potential sales each year if we release this idea |

## Viability

The viability section is not much different from what you would expect to see. It's divided into two separate sections---"revenue" and "profit"---and that’s where the differences end. All the viability data will auto-populate as you type in data under desirability and feasibility.

From here, you'll get a rough estimate for how long it'll take to hit your ROI and what your long-term revenue stream is for up to five years. Based on what you see, you can go back and make adjustments if necessary.

Again, this is a quick way to assess an opportunity. In the end, you should be able to say one of three things:

1. "This opportunity is good for our business."
2. "This opportunity is not good for our business."
3. "In order to make this a good opportunity, here's what we need to have."

# Metrics

> "Vanity metrics make you feel good, but don’t offer clear guidance on what to do." --- Eric Ries

Good metrics should tell a story that gives the observer a 360&deg; view of the landscape through the use of both quantitative and qualitative data, thereby letting them draw a solid hypothesis. However, a metric is only as good as its data source and how you present your dats. Don't rely much on metrics unless accurate quantitative and qualitative data supports it. If the data comes into question, or you become suspicious that the data may be incomplete or corrupted, toss it out. It’s better to start with a basic hypothesis than to make knee-jerk decisions with inaccurate data.

## Using KPI for Decision-Making

Similar to sales people and shiny things, stakeholders and decision-makers like numbers, bar graphs, and anything green. This is why they notoriously use KPIs to investigate variances and make knee-jerk decisions about their business processes or resources. Unfortuantely, dubious KPIs are adopted for vanity rather than a precise benchmark. Worse yet, if they lack the understanding of how to develop good measures, they'll resort to using percentages to quantify their measure.

Whether this is a good practice or not is irrelevant. What is relevant, though, is that bad measurements kill the actual quality and value of their work. For example, measuring the productivity of a software development team in terms of source lines of code encourages copy and paste code and over-engineered design, leading to bloated code bases that are particularly difficult to maintain, understand and modify.

This why it's important for you to question the metrics they gathered and even go as far as validating them yourself or rejecting them outright. Numbers may not lie, but they do stretch the truth.
