# Takeaways

Before diving in, browse through the following takeaways first.

1. It wasn't a waste of time if you learned something.

# Workflow

Rather than cherry picking another over-hyped methodology, we're taking a lightweight approach---one that not only has flexibility but also scales as our business matures. At the core of our workflow is a retooled version of Deming's iterative __PDSA cycle__. The difference, though, lies in the sequence and occurrences.

Essentially, this modernized workflow is designed to accommodate industry dynamics and team dependencies, split strategy and tactics, divide work among Core groups and Release groups, reduce subsequent cycle times, and allow you to make pivotal changes while you learn rather than before you release your product.

## Cycles

The cycles are intended to clarify how workloads travel and progress in a typical lifecycle. Whether it is a new product launch, a recurring maintenance project, or a single phase in an epic, the cycle's lightweight "loop-reloop"-like motions should easily compensate for all kinds of events.

| PDAS | Core | Release |
| ---- | ---- | ------- |
| Plan | Define | Plan |
| Do | Prototype | Build |
| Act | Review | Release |
| Study | Adapt | Learn |

## Workloads

The table below provides a brief description for each workload.

| Workload | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Adapt | |
| Build | Commissioning and overseeing the construction a structure, product, or situation |
| Define| Stating and decomposing the exact the idea, its scope, and the strategy for making it a viable and profitable solution |
| Learn | Becoming aware of problems or solutions by gathering ideas, input or from direct observations |
| Plan | Defining tasks that lead up to the introduction of a product or service to the public |
| Prototype | Elaborating the initial definition and frame its look and functionality |
| Release | |
| Review | Verifying expected deliverables and agreeing favorably to a release or launch |

# Framework

Our framework provides a much-needed standard language for cross-functional teams. Like a hierarchy of activities, it visually illustrates a sequence, or pattern, to follow during and after planning.

## Activity-Based Methods

This framework is coupled rather loosely. That's because it's __activity-based__, not process-based. And unlike process-based methods, it's less concerned with "how to" and more concerned about "what to do" and "why we're doing it".

All activities represent value-added work that either adds or improves the product in such a way that buyers and users are willing to pay for it. Most apply to every project, regardless of their size. The degree of rigor for each activity, however, will vary depending on:

* The type of project
* The characteristics of the product
* Concurrence of the teams
* Availability

## Event Correlation

From strategy to heads-down tactics, the framework covers the entire landscape using four events.

* Define and Prototype
* Review and Adapt
* Plan and Build
* Release and Learn

The image below illustrates how our activities correlate with those events.

# Postmortem

Postmortems (also called Post-Release Reviews or Retrospectives) come in handy at the start of a project to decide what elements need to improve, to avoid, or to augment based off the feedback gathered from former projects. These foster continuous improvements, mitigate any hiccups or mishaps, and promote best practices.

## The Starfish

Seeing as we have more of an activity-centric culture, rather than a process-driven one, slicing the feedback in a way that will decompose those activities and create the most valuable constructive feedback or action items is the most effective approach. This is why we use the Starfish format for reviews. In lieu of inaccuracies with the original matrix format, Agile/Scrum development teams have recently adopted this new format as a means to capture feedback that is not radioactive or misleading.

The descriptions for each category are as follows.

| Category | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Start Doing | Suggest new things |
| Do More | Are there value-add activities not being taken advantage of? |
| Keep Doing | Capture good things that happened |
| Do Less | Anything that needs more refining or that is simply waste |
| Stop Doing | What are some things that are not very helpful or not adding much value? |

## Transparency

Postmortem feedback should be visible to everyone. Exposing those weak areas where improvements are necessary is critical to drive continuous improvement (kaizen).
